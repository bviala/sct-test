## Technical choices

### Checkout class
Instead of the suggested Checkout class, I chose to follow Vue paradigms and use a Vuex store to manage the state of the shop.  
It provides several advantages:  
* It leverages Vue built-in reactivity system, so we don't have to handle it ourselves
* It cleanly separates business code from presentation code
* It saves us from having complex parent to child and child to parent component communication.

The store itself acts similarly to a Class: it has read-only attributes (state), that can be updated through exposed functions (mutations and actions), and also some getters.

### Scan method
The scan function also works differently from the one suggested.
As the UI allows the user to directly input any quantity, it makes the code more simple if the scan method takes a `quantity` parameter and set the quantity state with this value, rather than incrementing it by 1.  
The drawback is that we have to manually ensure the passed quantity is valid (no negative, no decimal, no text) when it would have been implicit with the suggested behaviour.

### Discounts

Discounts are implemented as Objects containing : 
* `scope`,  an array containing all the product codes the discount applies to.
* `name`, a string which is used to display purpose.
* `getValue`, a function that takes a `quantity` and `price` parameters and computes the value of the discount


It makes it easy to add new kind of discounts, or change the products they apply to.

I also built two factory functions to help create discount functions.

A limitation of this design is that it doesn't support cross product discounts, for example "get 3â‚¬ off if you buy a cap and a shirt".

To achieve this, the getValue functions would have to take the whole cart state as parameter, which would make the discount system more complex.
